  The use of software systems is becoming increasingly popular in modern society, as this growth rate grows, new learning methods and 
  techniques emerge that use these systems as a way to improve teaching and learning. This paper presents the step-by-step approach to the 
  construction of a gamified web tool, which aims to serve as a means of supporting the teaching and learning of programming in the discipline 
  "Algorithms and Computer Programming", offered at Gama Campus (FGA). University of Brasilia (UnB). The tool is based on similar studies and 
  tools, quizzes, games most played by students and the octalysis framework created by Yukai Chou. Also presented is the pedagogical content 
  covered by the tool as well as the process of choosing gamification techniques.
